🚀 .NET Core Performance Tip: Use Span<T> and Memory<T> for Faster, Allocation-Free Parsing



🔍 Why This Matters

When working with strings or arrays (especially large ones), operations like slicing or substring extraction often create unnecessary allocations, slowing down your app and increasing memory pressure.



✅ Span<T> and Memory<T> let you work with slices of data directly — no copying or heap allocations required.

⚡ Ideal for parsing, high-performance text processing, and memory-sensitive operations

🔒 Safe, bounds-checked, and works seamlessly in modern .NET
