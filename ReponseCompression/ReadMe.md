🗜️ .NET Core Tip – Improve API Speed with ResponseCompression
APIs often send large JSON or text payloads — especially in list endpoints, reports, or search results. These payloads can slow down clients, increase bandwidth usage, and degrade the user experience on slower networks.
One of the quickest and easiest performance wins you can make in ASP.NET Core is enabling Gzip or Brotli compression. It can reduce your response size by 50-80% — with minimal code changes. ✅

✅ Why use it?
🚀 Faster response times
⬇️ Reduced payload size
📱 Improved experience for mobile and low-bandwidth users
🔧 Easy to integrate in just a few lines of configuration
💡 Works automatically for clients that support Accept-Encoding: gzip or br.
⚠️ Make sure to test compression and only enable it when serving compressible content (like JSON, HTML, etc.).
