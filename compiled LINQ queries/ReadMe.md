ðŸš€ .NET Core Performance Tip: Use Compiled LINQ Queries in EF Core



In EF Core, every time you run a LINQ query, it gets parsed and compiled into SQLâ€”even if the logic hasn't changed. While that's fine for occasional use, this translation adds unnecessary CPU overhead and memory allocations in high-traffic apps like APIs or dashboards.

If you're running the same LINQ query frequently, pre-compile it using EF.CompileAsyncQuery to eliminate the repeated cost. Compiled queries are parsed once, thread-safe, and significantly faster in repeated executions.
