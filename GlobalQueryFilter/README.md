# 🧹 EF Core Global Query Filter Demo

This project demonstrates how to use **Entity Framework Core's Global Query Filters** to implement **soft delete** functionality in a clean and centralized way.

## 📌 What is a Global Query Filter?

In Entity Framework Core, a **global query filter** is a LINQ expression applied automatically to all queries for a given entity type. This is especially useful for implementing soft deletes, multi-tenancy, and other filtering logic without repeating conditions across your application.
