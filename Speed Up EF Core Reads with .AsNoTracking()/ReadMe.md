🧠 .NET Core Tip – Speed Up EF Core Reads with .AsNoTracking()
By default, Entity Framework Core tracks every queried entity — even if you're only reading data.
 That tracking adds overhead in terms of CPU and memory, especially for large datasets.
If you're working with read-only scenarios (like APIs, reports, or dashboards), you can disable tracking to significantly boost performance. ⚡
✅ Benefits
🚀 Faster queries
🧠 Lower memory usage
🔍 Ideal for read-only endpoints
⚠️ Important: Don't use .AsNoTracking() if you plan to modify and save the data — EF needs tracking for SaveChanges() to work.
